# Hands-On Intervention

This repository collects my robotics control labs and projects from the **Universitat de Girona** program.  
It covers the progression from basic kinematic simulation to advanced Task-Priority (TP) control for manipulators and mobile manipulators.

## 📂 Projects

- **Lab 2 – Resolved-Rate Motion Control**  
  Implemented kinematic simulation of a 2-link manipulator and applied resolved-rate control using Jacobian Transpose, Pseudoinverse, and Damped Least Squares.

- **Lab 3–5 – Task-Priority Kinematic Control**  
  Introduced Task-Priority control, recursive TP, and set-based tasks (obstacle avoidance, joint limits).

- **Lab 6 – Mobile Manipulator with TP Control**  
  Extended TP control to a differential-drive mobile base with a 3-link manipulator, including weighted DLS and base integration methods.
